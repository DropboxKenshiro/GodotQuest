# GodotQuest
A rougelike game made with tile graphics with an RPG elements. Basically, it's kinda early Ultimas, but mixed with NetHack(and deveriatives) and with an jRPG battle system. And randomly generated. That's the idea.

# Project status
Currently, I'm playing around with this. So really, nothing is really done now.

# Tools
The game itself is based on a wonderful Godot engine (https://godotengine.org/), and it's coded in a nice GDScript. It really eases the work.

# Build
DON'T DO THAT.

# Licensing
GodotQuest itself is licensed on MIT license. You can do nearly everything with the source code, if and only if you include reference to the original author (well, it's me). However, some components are licensed on diffrent rights:
